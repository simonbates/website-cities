<p>Including people who have lived experience of disability and marginalization was our main focus when organizing each of our co-design sessions. However, during those sessions, we noticed that it was very difficult for diverse participants to work together as they had conflicting needs, attitudes and perspectives.</p>

<p>These differences became apparent when groups were brought together to collaborate, and their interactions led to negative power dynamics, division of groups, side conversations, and disengagement of members. For example, in one session, two participants with vision loss became engrossed in discussing their ideas and unconsciously excluded the other two members of their team. Eventually, the other two members formed their own group, resulting in two separate groups forming within one. This made us more aware of conflicts that may arise in groups due to differences in participants’ perspectives and experiences.</p>

<p>Providing participants with an opportunity to get to know each other prior to engaging in the activity, giving the option to change groups, and communicating a roadmap of their progress improved group dynamics. Integrating interpreters, and personal assistants in the session, offering material in alternative formats, and making further examples/instructions available eased out groups workflow.</p>

<h3 id="try">TRY</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be observant of group dynamics and how members interact with each other</li>
<li>Provide assistance for groups that have several members with extreme needs</li>
<li>Provide simple and clear instruction about the process and how participants’ contribution can impact the community</li>
<li>Have supportive examples/ instructions</li>
<li>Offer materials in alternative format and make it available for anyone requiring them</li>
<li>Integrate translators, ASL interpreters, audio describers, personal assistant or who else can enable participants to equally participate</li>
</ul>
