<p>During our outreach process, we found it very difficult to engage specific groups, such as the indigenous community, the black community, LGBTQ2S, religious minorities, and different ethnicities. Some of these groups expressed consultation fatigue as the main reason for their lack of interest and willingness to participate. Although they were being asked for their opinion about different initiatives, they didn’t see their perspectives being integrated. Some others had experienced tokenism where they were only recruited to give the appearance of diverse engagement without their input being considered genuinely. Overall, they could not see how their participation might benefit their community and had no strong motivation or incentive to participate in a co-design process.</p>

<p>As we progressed, we also recognized that we often overlook the fact that marginalized groups, similar to any other community, have diverse needs and experience impurities, discrimination, exclusion, and hierarchies. Identifying outliers within marginalized communities was a fundamental challenge, that we could not address without the help of people and organizations who had a deeper understanding of each community’s needs and complex interrelationships.</p>

<ul>
<li>During your invitation process, be honest and transparent about the process, objectives, and outcomes</li>
<li>Clearly communicate how the collected information will be handled and the availability of financial or non financial incentives for participation</li>
<li>Work with communities and organizations who are working with marginalized groups</li>
<li>Engage marginalized groups in a discussion about how they experience exclusion within their communities</li>
</ul>
