<p>Our outreach process began with looking back at our objectives to identify people who were affected by our topic but excluded from the process. We generated a list of local groups and individuals who represented those missing perspectives. We shared the list with our partners for feedback and to add to our contacts. Once finalized, we began to send invitation emails to each contact, encouraging them to either join sessions by the IDRC team or run their own embedded co-design sessions within their community. The invitations were also posted on social media and sent to different mailing lists.</p>

<p>When planning our led-sessions, we were able to directly communicate with participants, know about their needs and preferences prior to the event, and ensure  diverse participation at each session. However, for the embedded sessions, we had no knowledge of who may attend, what their accessibility needs maybe, how to manage group dynamics as our partner organizations were responsible for engaging the participants and running the sessions.</p>

<p>However, having several planning meetings with our partner organizations helped to better understand their community, context, sensitivities, and accessibility requirements in advance. Being more flexible and providing various options for facilitators were also other strategies to address unexpected needs at the embedded co-design sessions.</p>

<h3 id="try">TRY</h3>

<ul>
<li>Identify vulnerable and marginalized groups who will be affected by your topic</li>
<li>Search for any advocate group, community, institutions, organization that is involved with those groups</li>
<li>Contact the people or organizations you have identified</li>
<li>Work with the organizations that agreed to participate to plan a co-design that best suits their needs, preferences and limitations</li>
<li>Be flexible and open to try new and different approaches</li>
</ul>
