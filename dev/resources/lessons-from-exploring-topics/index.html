<p>Although we have had a common theme, we had to explore different questions/topics working with various communities. Throughout this process, we noticed that abstract topics required more scaffolding because participants had difficulty understanding the topic and developed their own interpretations. For example, one of our co-design sessions with Sidewalk labs focused on  inclusive feedback mechanisms that could be implemented in the context of smart cities. This topic was too abstract and tied to new technologies that were hard to envision for most participants. As a result, most ideas included solutions to real life urban issues, such as the transit or health care system in Toronto rather than on mechanisms or tools that enable a smooth and inclusive feedback process for citizens.</p>

<p>As we progressed and worked more closely with our collaborators, we learned that we cannot explore all different aspects of a topic in one activity. First, we needed to unpack a topic, and then only select a few pieces to explore in a co-design activity. Even for those selected topics, we had to ensure that they were not too specific, their language was simplified, and they were supported by sufficient and clear instructions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select a general theme that you would like to explore through this collaborative activity</li>
<li>Discuss the following questions with your collaborators to refine the theme (share personal experiences):

<ul>
<li>How do you define this theme from your perspective?</li>
<li>What are the different characteristics/aspects of the theme?</li>
<li>What are the main values related to this theme?</li>
<li>Who are the people involved?</li>
<li>What kinds of activities are happening related to this theme?</li>
<li>What challenges/gaps are being experienced?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use your responses to further refine the theme and further break it down to sub-themes</li>
<li>Work with your collaborators to select one area</li>
<li>Ensure your final theme is clear, easy to understand, and supported by additional materials for further guidance and clarification.</li>
