<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>An occupancy sensor (pressure sensor, camera, etc.) in the street that lets people know about someone approaching on a bicycle or car if they&rsquo;re preparing to cross the street and / or currently in the street.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Someone who is blind or has low-vision is preparing to cross to the bike lane and would be notified auditorily that there is a biker approaching from the left and how much time before the bike/car will pass.</li>
<li>Someone who is deaf is preparing to cross the bike lane and would be notified via a watch vibration that there’s a bicyclist approaching from the left.</li>
<li>Someone is standing in the middle of the street and not paying attention; an electric AV approaches but doesn’t make a sound. This traffic warning notifies the person that there is an AV approaching and guides them off the street.</li>
<li>The light is green and the pedestrian has right of way, but there is a car approaching quickly that may run the light. This would notify the pedestrian that it is not yet safe to walk. (Only in a legacy vehicle situation).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="this-prototype-must-include">This prototype must include</h2>

<ul>
<li>A way to sense or indicate that someone is waiting to cross</li>
<li>A way to sense or indicate traffic that is approaching from at least 50m/150ft away (assuming vehicle travelling 40km/hr at outer limit).</li>
<li>How far away (in time) the vehicle is</li>
<li>Which direction it’s coming from</li>
<li>Produce an audible warning signal and description</li>
<li>Doesn’t require a phone</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="this-prototype-could-optionally-include">This prototype could optionally include</h2>

<ul>
<li>This could optionally provide a vibration or haptic signal as well (via smart watch or bracelet), and light up the space between the bicyclist/vehicle with a light path in the street that gets shorter as the bicyclist moves toward the crosswalk.</li>
<li>This could optionally integrate with the temporary physical tactile crosswalk to notify a biker that they should stop for a pedestrian.</li>
<li>This could optionally integrate with street lighting that would turn red if the person should not start crossing</li>
<li>This could optionally integrate with the AR demo to give you an auditory signal when the AR AVs approach you if you’re standing in the middle of the street.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="major-risks-to-work-on-what-do-we-hope-to-learn">Major risks to work on/ What do we hope to learn</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is it annoying to have loud sound coming from the street?</li>
<li>How often would this trigger in normal traffic patterns?</li>
<li>Is it annoying if this happens too frequently?</li>
<li>What happens if there are multiple vehicles (cars or bikes) approaching? How should we describe a line of cars (or normal traffic)?</li>
<li>Do occupancy sensors do a good job of predicting how long it’ll take for a vehicle to approach?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware-materials-needed">Hardware/materials needed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Occupancy sensor (pressure sensor or camera or radar)</li>
<li>Traffic sensor (radar or camera or LIDAR)</li>
<li>LED lights</li>
<li>Arduino</li>
<li>Sound emitting speaker, e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Basics-Making-Sound/">https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Basics-Making-Sound/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-skills-needed">Special skills needed</h2>

<ul>
<li>Arduino skills / sensors (some light hardware)</li>
</ul>
